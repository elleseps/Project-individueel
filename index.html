                <h2>THE POMODORO METHOD</h2>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
                    traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as
                    "Pomodoros".
                    After four Pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. The idea behind the technique is
                    to
                    use the
                    time pressure of the timer to increase focus and productivity. The method has been widely
                    adopted as
                    a tool to
                    help people stay focused and get things done. It can be used for studying, working, or
                    completing
                    any task that requires concentration.</p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Now is the time to finally get to work. Make a plan and write out your tasks on paper or with the
                    timer bellow. Set the timer and get to work. U got this! Don't forget
                    to take small breaks in between that's important too. You can also use the timer for this.
